Project 3:

Project 3A: Sobel and Hough 
- sobel:  /30
- hough 40/70
- Subtotal : 70/100

Notes: you aren't printing out results, or drawing lines, so it's hard to tell how, if at all, you tested your code.  Does it work?

Project 3B: Canny
- gaussian blur /10
- gradient /10 
- non-max 20/30 - how do you test it to make sure it works?
- threshold 5/10 - how did you pick these values?
- edge tracking: /30
- results and testing: 0/10 not enough test images!  Crashes on displa - can you confirm it works for you?
- Subtotal: 75/100

Total: 145/200
